  I specialize in building mobile responsive front-end UI applications that connect with APIs and other backend technologies. Im passionate about learning new technologies and 
  understand there is more than one way to accomplish a task. Though I am most proficient in building front-end applications using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React, I am a quick 
  learner and can pick up new tech stacks as needed. I believe that being a great developer is not using one specific language, but choosing the best tool for the 
  job.**VictorKoome1/VictorKoome1** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
